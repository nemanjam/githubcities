separate ssr layouts from client components, maybe server actions for forms
fix danger button text, tab title cursor pointer
fix eslint errors, error checking didnt work before
handle runtime env vars for multiple envs, arm1, opi, rpi, mpc and deploy
runtime env vars - must use ssr components
github actions deploy with tailscale
react-query for fetching or ssr
card list fix flex full height
cva css for components
frontend tests, vitest, playwright

client components because of localStorage auth
const token = localStorage.getItem('access_token');

https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template/discussions/1564

fix python formatting, 2 newlines between functions, 1 new lines ..., installed "charliermarsh.ruff" extension
keep backend tests running correctly
migrate cookie logic in frontend
tiangolo already uses react-query, its replaced with axios in next.js project
frontend has no tests, next.js deleted them, original has only playwright e2e, no unit tests
------
forward cookie from client on each request, instead of localStorage token
setup react query and regenerate client
setup error logger
```
