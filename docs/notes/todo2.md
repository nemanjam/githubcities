runtime env vars - must use ssr components
github actions deploy with tailscale
react-query for fetching or ssr
card list fix flex full height
cva css for components

client components because of localStorage auth
const token = localStorage.getItem('access_token');
refactor backend to use cookie instead of localStorage // important
